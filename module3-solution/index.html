    <section class="Chicken">
      <h3 class="text-center">Chicken</h3>
      <p>
        Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them
        in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of
        cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
        Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling,
        among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has
        become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower
        concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.
        The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different
        parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while
        less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates
        there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.
        The modern chicken is a descendant of red junglefowl hybrids along with the grey junglefowl first raised
        thousands of years ago in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.
        Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC. Chicken was one of the most
        common meats available in the Middle Ages. For thousands of years, a number of different kinds of chicken have
        been eaten across most of the Eastern hemisphere,including capons, pullets, and hens. It was one of the basic
        ingredients in blancmange, a stew usually consisting of chicken and fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned
        with spices and sugar.
        In the United States in the 1800s, chicken was more expensive than other meats and it was "sought by the rich
        because [it is] so costly as to be an uncommon dish." Chicken consumption in the U.S. increased during World War
        II due to a shortage of beef and pork. In Europe, consumption of chicken overtook that of beef and veal in 1996,
        linked to consumer awareness of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease).
        Modern varieties of chicken such as the Cornish Cross, are bred specifically for meat production, with an
        emphasis placed on the ratio of feed to meat produced by the animal. The most common breeds of chicken consumed
        in the U.S. are Cornish and White Rock.
        Chickens raised specifically for food are called broilers. In the U.S., broilers are typically butchered at a
        young age. Modern Cornish Cross hybrids, for example, are butchered as early as 8 weeks for fryers and 12 weeks
        for roasting birds.
        Capons (castrated cocks) produce more and fattier meat. For this reason, they are considered a delicacy and were
        particularly popular in the Middle Ages.

    <section class="Beef">
      <h3 class="text-center">Beef</h3>
      <p>
        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since
        prehistoric times. Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.
        Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short
        ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while
        other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat
        from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some
        varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail,
        liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as
        sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform
        encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull
        (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are
        cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for
        making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.
        Beef from steers and heifers is similar.Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies.
        The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in
        the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some
        stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation),
        where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.
        Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide,
        after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the
        People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest
        beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the
        average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption
        per capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in
        the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal
        per capita.
        In 2015, the world's largest exporters of beef were India, Brazil and Australia. Beef production is also
        important to the economies of Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Belarus and Nicaragua.
        Beef production has a high environmental impact per gram of protein.
        The word beef is from the Latin bōs,in contrast to cow which is from Middle English cou (both words have the
        same Indo-European root *gʷou-).After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England
        naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served. Thus, various Anglo-Saxon words were used
        for the animal (such as nēat, or cu for adult females) by the peasants, but the meat was called boef (ox)
        (Modern French bœuf) by the French nobles — who did not often deal with the live animal — when it was served to
        them. This is one example of the common English dichotomy between the words for animals (with largely Germanic
        origins) and their meat (with Romanic origins) that is also found in such English word-pairs as pig/pork,
        deer/venison, sheep/mutton and chicken/poultry (also the less common goat/chevon).Beef is cognate with bovine
        through the Late Latin bovīnus. The rarely used plural form of beef is beeves.

    <section class="Sushi">
      <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
      <p>
        Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯ̥ɕiꜜ] or [sɯ̥ꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯,
        sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as
        seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the
        one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).
        Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
        short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
        imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi,
        and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
        Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw
        fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
        Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented
        rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;the rice
        would be discarded before consumption of the fish.This early type of sushi became an important source of protein
        for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other
        contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.Narezushi
        still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.
        Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
        Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of
        enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar
        significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually
        abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became
        oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden
        (typically bamboo) molds.
